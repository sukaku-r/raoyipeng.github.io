## About Me

I was born and raised in Zhoukou, a city in Henan Province. Ever since I was a child, I’ve been drawn to logical thinking—something that naturally led me to fall in love with math. I remember even in middle school, I’d often find myself quietly working on math problems during other classes. That passion eventually brought me to the School of Mathematics and Statistics at Zhengzhou University, where I started to truly dive into my academic interests—a journey that I’m still happily pursuing today.

I enjoy living at a slower pace. Taking a walk after meals has become a daily ritual for me—it helps me clear my head and sort through my thoughts. I’m also a casual table tennis player, though I haven’t had much time to play since starting grad school. Hopefully, I can pick up the paddle again soon!

When I’m relaxing, you’ll often find me browsing Bilibili. I like following creators who share slices of life, talk about social issues, or just reflect on what gives life meaning. It’s a nice way to unwind and see the world through different lenses.
