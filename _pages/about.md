## About Me

I was born and raised in Zhoukou, a city in Henan Province. From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by logical thinking — a curiosity that naturally led me to fall in love with mathematics. Even in middle school, I often found myself quietly working on math problems during other classes. That passion eventually brought me to the School of Mathematics and Statistics at Zhengzhou University, where I began to explore my academic interests more deeply — a journey I’m still wholeheartedly pursuing today.

I enjoy living life at a slower, more deliberate pace. Taking a walk after meals has become a daily ritual that helps me clear my mind and organize my thoughts. I’m also a casual table tennis player, though I haven’t had much time to play since starting graduate school — something I hope to change soon.

When I’m relaxing, you’ll often find me browsing Bilibili. I enjoy watching creators who share everyday moments, discuss social issues, or reflect on what gives life meaning. It’s a refreshing way to unwind and see the world from different perspectives.
