I received my Bachelor's degree from [the School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www5.zzu.edu.cn/math/), Zhengzhou University in 2014.  
I earned my Ph.D. in 2023 from [the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science](http://www.amss.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of Academician [Junzhi Cui](http://homepage.amss.ac.cn/research/homePage/7c98177290ea438aa989559f0e3fa4c7/myHomePage.html).

My research interests include: multiscale fracture mechanics, computational mechanics, and neural network methods for numerical computation.

With a genuine love for mathematics, I dedicate my spare time to studying academic papers and deep-diving into challenging problems. As an example, here are my exploratory notes on [an eigenvalue problem](/assets/problem.pdf).

You can find my CV here: [Curriculum Vitae](/assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
