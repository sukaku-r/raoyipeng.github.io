## About Me

I was born in Zhoukou City, Henan Province, and have been fascinated by logical reasoning since childhood, which led to my strong performance in mathematics. Even during middle school, I would often ponder mathematical problems in other classes. This passion guided me to the School of Mathematics and Statistics at Zhengzhou University, where I began to fully pursue my academic interestsâ€”a journey that continues to this day.

I appreciate a slow-paced lifestyle, and an after-meal walk is an essential part of my daily routine. These walks help me organize my thoughts and calm my mind. I also enjoy playing table tennis, though I've had little time for it since starting graduate studies. I hope to pick up this hobby again in the future.

Additionally, I am an avid user of Bilibili, where I spend my leisure time following interesting content creators who share their lives, comment on current affairs, and reflect on society and the meaning of life.
