excerpt: 'We develop an energetically consistent framework for modeling dynamic deformation and fracture of brittle materials, in which both the elastodynamic equation and the damage/fracture law are derived from the same ɛ-order two-scale asymptotic approximation of the strain and kinetic energy functions, with strain gradient and strain rate effects naturally embedded. Based on these energy functions, Hamilton’s principle is applied to derive a strain gradient elastodynamic equation that naturally accounts for damage-induced softening. Concurrently, applying the Griffith criterion yields a microcrack evolution equation driven by macroscopic strain, strain gradient, and strain rate. The resulting brittle fracture model is shown to rigorously satisfy the Clausius–Duhem inequality. Moreover, both the elastodynamic equation and the damage/fracture law are governed by a concise set of coefficients, formulated as integrals over microscopic cell functions that depend exclusively on intrinsic material parameters—namely the elastic moduli, microcrack size, and microcrack spacing.
Numerical simulations show that neglecting strain-gradient and strain-rate terms in the elastodynamic governing equations leads to unphysical phenomena such as infinite wave speeds at short wavelengths and stress singularities at macrocrack notch tips. In contrast, the present energetically consistent modeling approach effectively eliminates these spurious effects. Furthermore, simulations based on the proposed model quantitatively reproduce results from dynamic fracture experiments, including damage zone characteristics, free surface velocity profiles, and the strain-rate dependence of dynamic fracture strength.'
